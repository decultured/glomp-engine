Actors have no data, only provide functions for binding to descriptions, collections or compositions, they only return an id-ed dummy class for calling functions (which just trigger events)

I.E. a Label would be created by:

local new_label = label.from(description)

new_label.load() -> sends a "load" event to the label through the notification system

	-> main thread would catch load and handle it, set "loaded" on description

	-> new_label could then act on the event "change:loaded" from main_thread, do someting like 		draw()

This could all be implemented as metamethods! (Roles just add metamethods to a description???)
