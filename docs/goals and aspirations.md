Game Programming should be fun

The engine should get out of the way

The game is more important than the technology

Experimentation should be encouraged

Ideas should be shared

	(Game dev community often very closed)

Should be easy to try new ideas
	
	not every idea that sounds good is, so we should be able to try new things quickly

Collaboration is critical
