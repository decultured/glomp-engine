This implementation mimics the JavaScript version mentioned on http://www.broofa.com/2008/09/javascript-uuid-function/ and available at http://www.broofa.com/2008/09/javascript-uuid-function/.
 
That implementation has a number of versions and I tried to Lua'fy the first default implementation without the variable radix support (fixed on 16).
 
When the BinDecHex library can be found, if will try to do the right stuff with the 20th hex of the uuid-string as far as and'ing and or'ing, but if it cannot find support for bitwise operations, it will simply generate another random hex-value.
Please see "http://www.dialectronics.com/Lua/" for details about the BinDecHex package.
 
WARNING - this is a hack - depends on the local random generator which seems quirky for the wrong seeds (so I do not use any seeding and push that responsibility on to the caller), it may not comply with the formal uuid/guid-spec for the 20th hex-value - do not fly airplanes that depend on this code... but at least it gives you nice looking guid/uuid-like strings that seem random enough for informal use.
 
If Ansca ever will provide proper support for the naive OS-guid/uuid-generators (as they should!), please discard this piece of code at your earliest convenience.
 
Enjoy, Frank.
